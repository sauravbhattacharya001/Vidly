A video rental store web application built with **ASP.NET MVC 5** that demonstrates core MVC patterns — routing, controllers, models, view models, and Razor views.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Movie Catalog** — Browse, create, edit, and delete movies with full CRUD support
- **Custom Routing** — Attribute-based routes for filtering movies by release date
- **View Models** — Composed data objects for rich, strongly-typed view rendering
- **Validation** — Data annotation-based model validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Thread-Safe Data Store** — Concurrent access handled via lock-based synchronization
- **Bundling & Minification** — Optimized client-side assets via `BundleConfig`
- **Bootstrap UI** — Clean, responsive interface using Bootstrap with the Lumen theme

## 🐳 Docker

Run Vidly in a Windows container with IIS:

```powershell
# Pull from GitHub Container Registry
docker pull ghcr.io/sauravbhattacharya001/vidly:latest

# Or build locally
docker build -t vidly .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name vidly vidly

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

Docker images are automatically built and pushed to [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/sauravbhattacharya001/Vidly/pkgs/container/vidly) on every push to `master` and on version tags.

> **Note:** Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with **Windows containers** enabled. The image uses `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8` which requires Windows Server Core.

## 📦 Packages

# Install the package
dotnet add package Vidly --source github
```

NuGet packages are automatically published on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
